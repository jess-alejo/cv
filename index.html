        <p class="intro">
          The computer is one of the coolest things ever invented.
          It alleviates our workload and makes our lives more convenient.
          But what is more impressive is how cryptic-like messages can turn that great machine into a slave.

          />
          <h3>In the beginning</h3>
          <p>
            My interest in programming sparkled when I saw a Visual FoxPro message box appears in front of a computer screen, displaying my name.
            Since then, my motivation to pursue programming has been so intense that I even asked my professor to use my preferred programming language in our thesis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Years passed, and so many things have changed. I continue learning and have added more programming languages in my toolbelt. I love C# and Ruby at most. But that very first fantastic moment is the most crucial experience in my career.

            alt="web-development-img"
          />
          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>
            Technology is so fast. Information is now accessible via the internet. I remember visiting my cousin's house to borrow an Encyclopedia to see information about dinosaurs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I found web development a challenging field. There are a lot of things to learn. Coming from desktop application development environment, my first struggle is using Vim and executing Linux commands in terminal. Then here comes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Then came a very mysterious framework, Ruby on Rails. Every year, new technologies, libraries, and updates came, and I think it will continue.

            src="images/creativity.png"
            alt="database-img"
          />
          <h3>Graphics and Design</h3>
          <p>
            My first skill I think I am aware of is drawing. I like arts and colors. I believe I was able to apply my imaginations and artistry in my work. But there still a lot to learn. Front-end development will be an excellent place to improve this skill.

          When not into coding, I listen to music, play video games, strumming a
          guitar, or riding a motorbike. I also enjoy eating and trying other
          cuisines. I favor small group gatherings with dear friends. I'm
          attracted to nature and beautiful scenery.
